Imagine that you have just launched a new advertising campaign, or a new product, just like Disney’s new movie “The Lion King”, and you want to have a clear view of what people think of the movie. Natural language processing (NLP) can help with that, and specifically the task of sentiment analysis (SA).

In simple terms, this is a technique that allows you to quickly determine if people are responding positively or negatively to a given topic—in this use case movies.
